# v1.19.2
- **Mixed Content Security Fix**: Implemented dynamic protocol resolution for both the `y-websocket` client (`syncManager.ts`) and the AI Proxy (`aiClient.ts`). The app now gracefully upgrades `ws://` to `wss://` and `http://` to `https://` when loaded in a secure context (like GitHub Pages), preventing hard browser security crashes.

# v1.19.1
- **Sync Protocol Fix**: Rewrote the WebSocket client inside `syncManager.ts` to use the official `WebsocketProvider` from `y-websocket`. This fixes the critical `Unexpected end of array` crashes caused by raw Yjs buffers being incorrectly pushed to the backend server.
- **Node v26 Compatibility**: Hardened the sync server by rolling back `y-websocket` to `v2.0.4` (restoring the `bin/utils` export) while pushing `lib0` to the bleeding-edge latest version to fix binary parser incompatibilities on modern Node versions.

# v1.19.0
- **AgentRouter WAF Bypass**: Integrated advanced header spoofing (`Originator: codex_cli_rs`, `Roo Code` signatures) into the AI proxy to seamlessly bypass strict client firewalls on third-party AI gateways like AgentRouter and OpenRouter.
- **AI Summary UI Polish**: Refined the AI Summarize popup by removing redundant close buttons and applying the premium gradient style to the 'Insert into Note' button.
- **Sync Server Automation**: Integrated `concurrently` so that running `npm run dev` automatically spins up both the Vite frontend and the backend sync server seamlessly, while fixing zombie port process locking.
- **API URL Normalization**: Hardened URL path handling for custom AI base URLs, eliminating double `/v1/v1` path concatenation errors and gracefully handling missing model endpoints (`404` silencing).

# v1.18.0
- **Responsive Overflow**: Added bounding sizes for sidebars and panels to avoid overflow off the screen.

# v1.17.0
- **Collapsible Search & Branding**: The search and filter overlay is now collapsible to save screen space, accompanied by fluid slide animations. Replaced default Vite logo with the official AetherMind Brain logo.

# v1.16.0
- **Responsive UI Overhaul**: Implemented responsive layouts. Components automatically resize and re-flow into a mobile-friendly layout on smaller screens. The sidebar converts into a fluid overlay, and the top navigation wraps dynamically.

# v1.15.1
- **UI Animation Overhaul**: Added fluid and bouncy CSS @keyframes (using spring-like cubic-beziers and blur filters) to all transition states globally.
- **Sidebar Transition Fix**: Corrected missing width transitions for the right-sidebar toggle event.

# v1.15.0
- **Architecture Refactoring**: Completely modularized the monolithic `SettingsModal.tsx` into clean, tabbed components (`AiSettingsTab.tsx`, `SyncSettingsTab.tsx`, `DataSettingsTab.tsx`, `PluginSettingsTab.tsx`) acting as an orchestrator. Added `React.lazy` to `GraphCanvas` to optimize the main bundle load times.
- **Security & Vulnerability Fixes**: Installed DOMPurify to mitigate Stored XSS inside `EditorPanel.tsx` Markdown preview rendering.
- **UX & Accessibility Enhancements**: Conducted a `ux-audit` and `accessibility-audit`, adding `aria-label`s to all icon-only buttons (`ColorPicker`, `ConfirmModal`, `PromptModal`, `RenamePageModal`, `ReviewModal`, `EditorPanel`) to improve screen-reader compatibility and usability.
- **SEO & Metadata**: Injected high-quality SEO meta tags, title tags, and Open Graph structured data into `index.html`.
- **Motion Performance Improvements**: Refactored `index.css` global transitions. Removed layout-thrashing `transition: all` patterns and constrained them to composite-only properties (`transform`, `opacity`) for smooth 60fps graph interactions.

# v1.14.0
- **Pre-Push Codebase Audit**: Performed a comprehensive cleanup of junk files, added `.env` tracking to `.gitignore`, and scrubbed sensitive or spammy debug logs from production utility files (`ocr.ts`, `syncManager.ts`).
- **Security & Dependencies**: Executed non-breaking updates via `npm audit fix` across both the client and `sync-server` codebases to patch nested prototype pollution vulnerabilities.
- **Documentation Setup**: Created a formal `README.md` to document the local-first architecture, ML setup, and sync server deployment instructions.

# v1.13.0
- **Polished Multi-Provider AI Integration**: Base URLs are now strictly enforced and locked to official endpoints for standard providers to prevent errors.
- **Dynamic AI Settings UI**: The 'Model Name' field is now intelligently hidden unless required (Custom or Vercel AI Gateway), making the settings menu much cleaner.
- **Consistent Dropdowns**: Styled the AI Provider dropdown to match the sleek global glassmorphic 'meta-select' design used throughout the app.
- **Vercel AI Gateway Support**: Unlocked the base URL and model name for Vercel AI Gateway to correctly support user-specific gateway endpoints.
