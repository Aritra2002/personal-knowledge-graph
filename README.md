## 👑 The Vision

**AetherMind** is not just another note-taking app. It is a robust, local-first Personal Knowledge Graph engineered with CRDTs to ensure your data is always yours. With deep, privacy-preserving AI integrations running directly on your machine or through secure proxies, AetherMind helps you cultivate ideas without compromising security.

---

## ✨ Premium Features

*   🌍 **Local-First Architecture**: Your data stays on your device and operates effortlessly without a centralized database.
*   🧠 **Deep AI Integration**: Harness local AI models via `@xenova/transformers` for capabilities like Voice Dictation, Text-to-Speech, and smart semantic organization.
*   🛡️ **Advanced AI Proxy Gateway**: Built-in backend proxy effortlessly bypasses strict WAF firewalls (e.g., AgentRouter, OpenRouter) by spoofing authorized client headers, giving you ultimate flexibility between local and cloud LLMs.
*   🌌 **Interactive Graph Visualization**: Explore the cosmos of your thoughts with a rich, physics-based interactive node graph.
*   📱 **Adaptive Responsive UI**: A meticulously crafted interface boasting fluid animations, glowing glassmorphism, and seamless mobile-to-desktop responsiveness.
*   🔌 **Dynamic Plugin Ecosystem**: Dynamically load external JavaScript plugins to effortlessly extend your workspace functionality.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Master Repository Setup

Clone the repository and install the primary frontend dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/personal-knowledge-graph.git
cd personal-knowledge-graph
npm install
```

### 2. Ignition

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

*   🚀 **The Web Application** will ignite on port `5173`.

## ⚙️ Configuration & Architecture

Customize your environment by copying the configuration template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

### Connecting to AI Providers
AetherMind's proxy gateway gives you absolute control over your intelligence layer:
1.  **Local LLMs:** Connect directly to LM Studio, Ollama, or llama.cpp for total offline privacy.
2.  **Cloud Providers:** Connect to OpenAI, Anthropic, or AgentRouter. Navigate to the **AI Provider** tab in the Settings menu to configure endpoints and API keys.

---

## 🏗️ Building for Production

Compile a highly-optimized, static production bundle ready for deployment anywhere:

```bash
npm run build
```
The compiled assets will be generated in the `dist/` directory, primed for deployment on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS.
